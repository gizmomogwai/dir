# dir
ls implementation in dlang.

# usage
dir is not compatible with ls.
dir always works like ls in list mode.
look at dir --help for commandline options.

## philosophy
only two flags are supported:

### columns (-c)
with columns you activate the columns you want to see.
capital column ids are used for "color" columns.

### sorting (-s)
